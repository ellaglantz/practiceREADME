# Proof of Planning 

> Our Process of thinking went like: 
>> The starting class will include all objects. We will use constructors in order to allow the initialization for certain classes and their weights.
>> We will gave 3 studentds with their own CVS files holding grades. The CVS files will be hardcoded with grades so that the user will only need to
>> press a button to see the results for each student and the corresponding grades. The program will print out Student's Name, their class, and the
>> grade they will recieve for that class.We will include 4 class types which will be intialzied with different constructors. These will each have
>> their own respective weights for each object Math, Science, Writing, Comp-sci


> Below is an exmaple of pseudocode for the Gradebook calculate function seen in our grades.cpp file:

`double Gradebook::calculate(std::string filename){
    //create sum variable
    
    //Open file for reading
    
    //Create a 2d vector to hold the grades found in the file name
    
    //create an empty2d vector to store the elements of the CSV file
        //csv file should be grades for each "weight group" and should be in alphabetical order (as seen below)
        
    
    
    if(class_type == "Math"){
        //subvector[0][0] will be assignments grades
        //subvector[1][0] will be attendance grades
        //subvector[2][0] will be final_exam grades
        //subvector[3][0] will be midterm grades
        //subvector[4][0] will be quiz grades
        
        //get average for each subvector
        
        //use average and multiply by respective weight to get
        
        //return sum variable
    }else if(class_type == "Science"){
        //subvector[0][0] will be assignments grades
        //subvector[1][0] will be classwork grades

    }else if(class_type == "Computer"){
        //subvector[0][0] will be assignments grades
        //subvector[1][0] will be final_exam grades
